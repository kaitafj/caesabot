### Running caesabot Locally

You can test caesabot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

Before starting caesabot, you need install `nodejs`, `npm` and `redis`
You can install them on MacOSX:

    $ brew install nodejs
    $ brew install npm
    $ brew install redis

Now you can start caesabot locally by running:

    $ git clone https://github.com/kaitafj/caesabot.git
    $ cd caesabot
    $ bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    caesabot>

Then you can interact with caesabot by typing `caesabot help`.

    caesabot> caesabot help
    ...

### Deploying to Linux

You also need `nodejs`, `npm` and `redis` for your Linux.
Then, you can deploy caesabot to Linux.

    $ cd ~/caesabot
    $ git pull origin master
    $ forever stop 0
    $ ./caesabot.sh

`caesabot.sh` is not included in this repo for security reason.
The script is simple and should include :

    $ cat caesabot.sh
    #!/bin/sh

    set -e

    npm install

    export PATH="node_modules/.bin:node_modules/hubot/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
    export HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=<TOKEN_ON_SLACK_INTEGRATION_PAGE>
    export METADATA_API_KEY=<METADATA_API_KEY>

    if forever list | grep slack
    then
      forever stop 0
    fi

    forever start -c coffee node_modules/.bin/hubot --name "caesabot" --adapter slack
